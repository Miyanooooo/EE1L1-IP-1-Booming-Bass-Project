\par{The Integrated Project is a vital aspect of the Bachelor of Electrical Engineering. In the first and second quarters, students collaborate in teams to design and build a sound amplifier system for a speaker, leveraging knowledge acquired in the Linear Circuits A \& B courses. The amplifier system will be divided into several key components: three filters tailored to each of the distinct speaker cones, a dedicated power supply, and a power amplifier.

Group B2 has two lab sessions per week, during which there will be a focus on planning, building, and evaluating the amplifier system we designed. At the end of the project, our extension will be attached to a speaker and evaluated using TU Delft's speaker measurement equipment. Assessments will be based on the speaker's sound quality, with performance comparisons made between all groups to determine which group has the most successful design.}
